### [NobBS: Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing](https://github.com/sarahhbellum/NobBS)
* Curation status: published
* Created by: McGough S (sfm341@mail.harvard.edu), Johansson M (mjohansson@cdc.gov), Lipsitch M (mlipsitc@hsph.harvard.edu), Menzies N (nmenzies@hsph.harvard.edu) 
* Description: NobBS is Bayesian approach to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported cases from incomplete, time-stamped reporting data for disease outbreaks. NobBS learns the reporting delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve to produce smoothed nowcasts in both stable and time-varying case reporting settings.
